# NutritionFacts Live Q&A Browser

## Introduction 

[NutritionFacts.Org](https://nutritionfacts.org/) is one of the leading sources for scientific data on Nutrition and Health. 

They provide a lot of free material such as videos, webinars, articles and monthly Live Q&As.

## Problem trying to address

While the best source for a review of a certain topic is definetely the video section,\
some questions asked on the Live Q&As are not addressed previously.

Although most if not all videos on the platform are transcribed, the Live Q&As are not.

This tool will allow you to quickly search all Live Q&A for a specific term or nutrient question.
